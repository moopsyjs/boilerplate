# Moopsy Boilerplate ('-')

This is essentially a Create React App Typescript boilerplate in `frontend/` with some stuff removed and the Moopsy Client added, and a NodeJS app in `backend/` with the Moopsy Server added. You'll notice that this implementation is both extremely simple, but extremely flexible, as the entire frontend app and the entire backend app are exposed to you.

### Some Extras

The `Dockerfile` allows you to dockerize the app for deployment.
